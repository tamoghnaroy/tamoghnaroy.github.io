I work in the intersection of Machine Learning and Signal Processing. Currently, I work at [DeepSig](https://www.deepsig.ai/) where I work on applications of Deep Learning for wireless communications systems like - [this](https://www.deepsig.ai/omnisig), [this](https://www.deepsig.ai/omnisig-studio) and [this](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deepsig-deep-learning-wireless-communications). 

Prior to joining industry, I completed my PhD and MS - both in Electrical Engineering from [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/). You can find a complete list of my [papers](/publications/) and [patents](/patents/). 

If you want to know more about my work or just want to say hi, reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamoghnaroy/).
