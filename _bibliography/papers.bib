  abstract={Signal recognition is a spectrum sensing problem that jointly requires detection, localization in time and frequency, and classification. This is a step beyond most spectrum sensing work which involves signal detection to estimate "present" or "not present" detections for either a single channel or fixed sized channels or classification which assumes a signal is present. We define the signal recognition task, present the metrics of precision and recall to the RF domain, and review recent machine-learning based approaches to this problem. We introduce a new dataset that is useful for training neural networks to perform these tasks and show a training framework to train wideband signal recognizers.},

  abstract={In response to campus closures due to COVID-19, the learning environment in a foundational engineering course unexpectedly shifted from hands-on, collaborative work to remote delivery, accomplished within a short period of time. Through end-of-semester course surveys, students were asked open-ended questions to get feedback about their experience with the goal of using student feedback for curriculum planning and improvement should there be continued need to facilitate the course remotely in subsequent semesters. However, with 1,170 responses, the volume of data made it challenging to analyze, interpret and use the feedback for decision-making for following semesters. To address this challenge, we utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) based techniques - algorithmic ways to analyze, interpret, and present words and sentiments from student responses visually, to inform a novice-led analysis to ultimately help with course planning for future semesters.},

  abstract={Adaptive LMS (Least Mean Square) equalizers are widely used in digital communication systems for their simplicity of implementation. Conventional adaptive filtering theory suggests that the upper bound on performance of such an equalizer is determined by the performance of a Wiener filter of the same structure. However, in the presence of a narrowband interferer the performance of the (normalized) LMS equalizer can be better than that of its Wiener counterpart. The Bi-scale NLMS (BLMS) algorithm enhances this NLMS (Normalized LMS) characteristic by simultaneously using two instantiations of NLMS that run at very different time scales. In this paper, the derivation of a predictive model for the MSE (Mean Square Error) performance of the BLMS equalizer as narrowband interference canceler is shown. The predictive model can be used to adjust canceler parameters on the fly without the delay needed for time-consuming simulations. Simulation results validate the proposed MSE model, which is shown to predict performance of the BLMS equalizer over a wide range of parameters.},

Replay attacks and "DRFMs" have long been commonly used to deceive and probe radio systems, however generative models introduce an interesting new angle wherein generative replay can now produce examples of signals of similar structure and properties to arbitrary signals which are not verbatim replays and which may be varied in an infinite number of ways. Further, as GANs have demonstrated a strong ability to learn distributions from complex scenes and datasets, we consider the task of full-band spectral generation in addition to single signal generation to validate and demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach, to refine the algorithmic approach, and to quantify and illustrate the capabilities of such an approach on modern day signal sets.},

Most prior work in designing or learning new modulation schemes has focused on using simplified analytic channel models such as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh fading channels or other similar compact parametric models. In this paper, we extend recent work training generative adversarial networks (GANs) to approximate wireless channel responses to more accurately reflect the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of stochastic channel behaviors. We introduce the use of variational GANs to provide appropriate architecture and loss functions which accurately capture these stochastic behaviors. Finally, we illustrate why prior GAN-based methods failed to accurately capture these behaviors and share results illustrating the performance of such as system over a range of complex realistic channel effects.},

  abstract={Traditional cyber security and monitoring systems rely on prior knowledge about possible attacks, which renders them ineffective against novel schemes (zero-day attacks). Moreover, intruders are targeting different types of devices (e.g. Programmable Logic Circuits/Controllers (PLC)) for which traditional security systems are unavailable. A solution to this problem is provided by analysis of the power consumption behavior of a system and relating power consumption characteristics to behavior internal to the device. In this work, a detection system is developed which is capable of discriminating between different codes executed by the target device, a PLC, based on passive measurement at the external power supply point; this is unlike previous methods, which relied on a specific sensor located directly over the chip. Results show that for a PLC, which is executing four different codes, the classification system can discriminate with very high accuracy (> 99%).},

By adopting an adversarial approach for learning a channel response approximation and information encoding, we jointly learn a solution to both tasks applicable over a wide range of channel environments.

We introduce the basic approach explain how labeled training data containing wideband spectrum annotated with masks and bounding boxes can be used to train a highly effective radio signal detector which achieves higher levels of contextual understanding and improved sensitivity performance when compared with more traditional nave energy thresholding based signal detection schemes. We extend prior work from the computer vision field, employing a variation of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture which is a fast and accurate visual object detector.

Through this study, we describe the use of a Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing based textual data analytics to understand the word choices in the mission statements of U.S. based colleges of engineering. Our purpose is to understand the key similarities and differences between the choice of words used in the mission statements of the two groups: public colleges and private colleges of engineering. We were specifically interested in studying the terms related to diversity and inclusion and see the trends in the use of specific terms relating to diverse communities, intersections, minority populations, and the like. In this research study, we used a Word2Vec approach to visualize the words from mission statements for 59 colleges of engineering in the United States. The contribution of this research is in the form of a visualization mapping the vector space model for word usage and complete vocabulary of pertinent words from the statements analyzed. The preliminary results of this study will help inform current state of vocabulary used in mission statements in the colleges of engineering across the United States. Ultimately, such analyses can help administrators in the development of strategies on the formation of mission and vision statements for universities by allowing insight into vocabulary currently used, to understand what words/terms may not be adequately addressed. Additionally, we are excited to present a contemporary textual data analytical technique of Natural Language Processing using a word vector representation tool such as word2vec for analyzing textual data in the field of engineering education.},

While mean squared error (MSE) relates to bit error rate (BER), their connection is not necessarily a direct one when the detector output noise is not Gaussian. We show that BER can be increasing for increasing signal power (or decreasing noise power) even though MSE is decreasing. A Gaussian BER model may not be accurate then. For digital modulation schemes using FIR Wiener equalizers in a narrowband interference dominated environment, a Gaussian sum model is derived for the Wiener filter output. The analytical evaluation of the probability of bit error based on the Gaussian sum model produces a BER prediction that is shown to provide a close match with observed/estimated BER, in particular for lower order equalizers.},
